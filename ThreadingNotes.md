## Enabling Cross-talk Detection in Voice Assistant

To allow **interruption while AI is speaking**, you need to:

### Concurrent Audio Playback & Listening

- Do **not stop transcription** while playing the AI's voice.
- Use **threading** or **asynchronous handling** to play audio while continuing to listen.

---

### Example Change

**Instead of this:**
```python
self.stop_transcription()
# speak
self.start_transcription()
```
---

**Use threading like this:**

```python
import threading

def generate_ai_response(self, transcript):
    self.full_transcript.append({"role":"user", "content": transcript.text})
    print(f"\nUser: {transcript.text}", end="\r\n")

    response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model = "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages = self.full_transcript
    )

    ai_response = response.choices[0].message.content
    self.full_transcript.append({"role":"assistant", "content": ai_response})
    print(f"\nAI Receptionist: {ai_response}")

    # Speak AI response in separate thread
    threading.Thread(target=self.generate_audio, args=(ai_response,)).start()
```
---

### Benefits of This Approach

- 🎙️ The **microphone stays open** — transcription continues while AI is speaking.
- 🗣️ If the **user talks**, the `on_data()` method will **capture it in real time**.
- ✋ You can add logic to **stop audio playback mid-stream** if needed.

  - (Consider managing `stream(audio_stream)` with an interrupt or stop flag.)

> 🔧 This approach makes your assistant more responsive and human-like by supporting real-time user interruption.
